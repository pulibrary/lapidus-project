	<salute>My Friends and Countrymen,</salute>
	
	<p>PERMIT me to address you upon a subject, which, next to
	your eternal welfare in a suture world, demands your most
	serious and dispassionate consideration. The American Colonies
	are unhappily involved in a scene of confusion and
	discord. The bands of civil society are broken; the authority
	of government weakened, and in some instances taken away:
	Individuals are deprived of their liberty; their property is
	frequently invaded by violence, and not a single Magistrate
	has had courage or virtue enough to interpose. From this
	distressed situation it was hoped, that the wisdom and
	prudence of the Congress lately assembled at Philadelphia,
	would have delivered us. The eyes of all men were turned to
	them. We ardently expected that some prudent scheme of
	accommodating our unhappy dispute with the Mother-Country,
	would have been adopted and pursued. But alas! they are broken
	up without ever attempting it: They have taken no one step
	thus tended to peace: They have gone on from bad to worse, and
	have either ignorantly misunderstood, carelessly neglected, or
	basely betrayed the interests of all the Colonies.</p>
	
	<pb n="4" facs="page_image04" />
	
	<p>I shall in this, and some future publication, support this
	charge against the Congress, by incontestible facts: But my
	first business shall be to point out to you some of the
	consequences that will probably follow from the
	Non-importation, Non-exportation, and Non-consumption
	Agreements, which they have adopted, and which they have
	ordered to be enforced in the most arbitrary manner, and under
	the severest penalties. On this subject, I choose to address
	myself principally to you the Farmers of the Province of
	New-York, because I am most nearly connected with you, being
	one of your number, and having no interest in the country but
	in common with you; and also, because the interest of the
	farmers in general will be more sensibly affected, and mere
	deeply injured by these agreements, than the interest of any
	other body of people on the continent. Another reason why I
	choose to address myself to you is, because the Farmers are of
	the greatest benefit to the state, of any people in it: They
	furnish food for the merchant, and mechanic; the raw materials
	for most manufactures, the stable exports of the country, are
	the produce of their industry: be then convinced of your own
	importance, and think and act accordingly.</p>

	  <p>The Non-importation Agreement adopted by the Congress is
	  to take place the first day of December next; after which no
	  goods, wares, or merchandize, are to be imported from
	  Great-Britain or Ireland; no East-India Tea from any part ot
	  the world; no melasses, syrups, paneles, coffee, or pimento,
	  from our islands in the West-Indies; no wine from Madeira,
	  or the Western-Islands; no foreign indigo.</p>

	  <p>The Non-exportation Agreement is to take effect on the
	  tenth day of September next; after which we are not to
	  export, directly or indirectly, any merchandize or commodity
	  whatsoever to Great-Britain, Ireland, or the West-Indies,
	  except Rice to Europe,---unless the several acts and parts
	  of acts of the British Parliament, referred to by the fourth
	  article of Association, be repealed.</p>

	  <p>The Non-consumption Agreement is to be in force the first
	  day of March next; after which we are not to purchase or use
	  any East-India Tea whatsoever; nor any goods, wares, or
	  merchandize from Great-Britain or Ireland, imported after the
	  first of December, nor molasses, &amp;c. from the
	  West-Indies; nor wine from Madeira, or the Western Islands,
	  nor foreign indigo.</p>

	  <pb n="5" facs="page_image05" />

	  <p>Let us now consider the probable consequences of these
	  agreements, supposing they should take place, and be exactly
	  adhered to. The first I shall mention is, clamours, discord,
	  confusion, mobs, riots, insurrections, rebellions, in
	  Great-Britain, Ireland, and the West-Indies. This
	  consequence does not indeed immediately affect You, the
	  Farmer of New-York; nor do I think it a probable one: But
	  the Congress certainly intended it should happen in some
	  degree, or the effect they propose from these agreements
	  cannot possibly take place. They intend to distress the
	  manufacturers in Great-Britain, by depriving them of
	  employment---to distress the inhabitants of Ireland, by
	  depriving them of flax seed, and of a vent for their
	  linens,---to distress the West-India people, by
	  withholding provisions and lumber from them, and by stopping
	  the market for their produce. And they hape, by these means,
	  to force them all to join their clamours with ours, to get
	  the acts complained of, repealed. This was the undoubted
	  design of the Congress when these agreements were framed;
	  and this is the avowed design of their warm supporters and
	  partizans, in common conversation.</p>

	  <p>But where is the justice, where is the policy of this
	  procedure? The manufacturers of Great-Britain, the
	  inhabitants of Ireland, and of the West-Indies, have done us
	  no injury. They have been no ways instrumental in bringing
	  our distress upon us. Shall we then revenge ourselves upon
	  them?  Shall we endeavour to starve them into a compliance
	  with our humours?  Shall we, without any provocation, tempt
	  or force them into riots and insurrections which must be
	  attended with the ruin of many---probably with the death of
	  some of them?  Shall we attempt to unsettle the whole
	  British Government---to throw all into confusion, because
	  our self will is not complied with?  Because the
	  ill-projected, ill-conducted, abominable scheme of some of
	  the colonists, to form a republican government, independant
	  of Great-Britain, cannot otherwise succeed?---Good God! can
	  we look forward to the ruin, destruction, and desolation of
	  the whole British Empire, without one relenting thought?
	  Can we contemplate it with pleasure; and promote it with all
	  our might and vigour, and at the same time call ourselves
	  his Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects?  Whatever the
	  Gentlemen of the Congress may think of the matter, the
	  spirit that dictated such a measure, was not the spirit of
	  humanity.</p>


	  <p>Next let us consider the policy, or rather impolicy of
	  this measure.  Instead of conciliating, it will alienate the
	  affections of the people of Great-Britain. Of friends it
	  will make them our 


	  <pb n="6" facs="page_image06" />

	  enemies; it will excite the resentment of the government at
	  home against us; and their resentment will do us no good,
	  but, on the contrary, much harm.</p>

	  <p>Can we think to threaten, and bully, and frighten the
	  supreme government of the nation into a compliance with our
	  demands?  Can we expect to force a submission to our peevish
	  and petulant humours, by exciting clamours and riots in
	  England?  We ought to know the temper and spirit, the power
	  and strength of the nation better. A single campaign, should
	  she exert her force, would ruin us effectually. But
	  should she choose less violent means, she has it in her
	  power to humble us without hurting herself. She might raise
	  immense revenues, by laying duties in England, Ireland and
	  the West-Indies, and we could have no remedy left; for this
	  non-importation scheme cannot last for ever.  She can
	  embarrass our trade in the Mediterranean with Spain,
	  Holland, &amp;c. nor can we help ourselves; for whatever
	  regulations she should make, would effectually be enforced
	  by the same Navy that she keeps in readiness to protect her
	  own trade.</p>

	  <p>We shall also, probably, raise the resentment of the
	  Irish and West-Indians. The passions of human nature are
	  much the same in all countries.  If they find us disposed
	  wantonly to distress them, to serve our own purposes, will
	  they not look out for some method to do without us?  Will
	  they not seek else-where for a supply of those articles,
	  which they used to take from us?  They would deserve to be
	  despised for their meanness, did they not.</p>

	  <p>Holland, the Baltic, and the river St. Lawrence, would
	  afford the Irish a sufficient supply of flax-seed. If they
	  look out in time they cannot be disappointed. Canada
	  produces no inconsiderable quantity already.---</p>

	  <p>I have been well informed, that many bushels have been
	  bought up there at a low price, brought to New-York, and sold
	  to the Irish factors at a great advance. Are the Irish such
	  novices in navigation, that they cannot find the way to
	  Quebec? Or are they so blind to their own interest, as to
	  continue giving a high price for flax-seed at New-York, when
	  they might have a considerable supply from Canada, at a much
	  more reasonable rate?</p>

	  <p>You will say that as soon as the Irish send their ships
	  to Quebec for seed, the price will rise till it comes to an
	  equality with ours. I know it. I know also, that the
	  more the price rises, 

	  <pb n="7" facs="page_image07" />


	  the more Canadians will be encouraged to raise it. I know,
	  also, that the more they raise and sell, the less demand
	  there will be for ours, and the less price it will fetch at
	  market.</p>

	  <p>Nor should we distress the inhabitants of the West-Indies
	  so much as at first sight we may imagine. Those islands
	  produce now many of the necessaries of life. The quantity
	  may easily be encreased. Canada would furnish them with many
	  articles they now take from us; flour, lumber, horses,
	  &amp;c. Georgia, the Floridas, and the Mississippi abound in
	  lumber; Nova-Scotia in fish. All these countries will be
	  enriched by our folly, and would laugh at it.</p>

	  <p>When a trading people carelessly neglect, or wilfully
	  give up any branch of their trade, it is seldom in their
	  power to recover it. Should the Irish turn their trade for
	  flax-seed to Quebec; and the West-Indians get their flour,
	  horses, &amp;c. from thence, or other places; the loss to
	  the farmers of this province would be immense. The last
	  non-importation scheme turned the Indian trade from New-York
	  down the river St. Lawrence; we are now repeating, with
	  regard to our flour and flax-seed, the same blunder we then
	  committed with regard to the Indian trade. The consequence
	  however, will be much worse. The loss of the Indian trade,
	  was a loss to the merchants only; but the loss of the
	  flax-seed trade, will be a loss to every farmer in the
	  province, and a loss which he will severely feel.</p>

	  <p>You know, my Friends, that the sale of your feed not only
	  pays your taxes, but furnishes you with many of the little
	  conveniences and comforts of life; the loss of it for one
	  year would be of more damage to you than paying the
	  three-penny duty on tea for twenty. Let us compare matters a
	  little. It was inconvenient for me this year to sow more
	  than one bushel of seed. I have threshed and cleaned up
	  eleven bushels. The common price now is at least ten
	  shillings;<note place="foot">Since this piece
	  was written, the price of flax-seed is risen to thirteen
	  shillings per bushel.</note> my seed then will fetch me five
	  pounds, ten shillings. But I will throw in the ten shillings
	  for expences. There remains five pounds; in five pounds are
	  four hundred three-pences; four hundred three-pences
	  currency will pay the duty upon two hundred pounds of tea,
	  even reckoning the exchange with London at 200 per cent,
	  that is, reckoning 100l. sterling, to be equal to
	  200l. currency; whereas in fact it is only equal to 175 or
	  180l. at the most. I use in my family about six pounds of
	  tea : few farmers in my neighbourhood


	  <pb n="8" facs="page_image08" />


	  use so much : but I hate to stint my wife and daughters, or
	  my friendly neighubour when they come to see me. Besides, I
	  like a dish of tea too, especially after a ittle more than
	  ordinary fatigue in hot weather. Now 200 pounds of tea, at
	  six pounds a year, will last just 33 years, and eight
	  months. So that in order to pay this monstrous duty upon
	  tea, which has raised all this confounded combustion in the
	  country, I have only to sell the produce of a bushel of
	  flax-seed once in THIRTY-THREE years. Ridiculous!</p>

	  <p>But, to leave jesting. The loss of the sale of your feed
	  only for one year, would be a considerable damage to
	  you. And yet the Congress have been so inattentive to your
	  interests, that they have laid you under, almost, an
	  absolute necessity of losing it the next year. They have
	  decreed, and proclaimed a non-exportation, to commence in
	  September next. The Irish will be alarmed. They will look
	  out somewhere else. Or should they determine to send their
	  ships the earlier, we cannot, without the utmost
	  inconvenience, get our feed to market by that time ;
	  especially, not from the remoter parts of the province. The
	  consequence will be, that we must sell our seed at the
	  oil-mills in New-York, just at the price the manufacturers
	  shall please to give us.</p>

	  <p>Upon the whole then, it is highly improbable that we
	  shall succeed in distressing the people of Great-Britain,
	  Ireland, and the West-Indies, so far as to oblige them to
	  join with us in getting the acts of Parliament which we
	  complain of, repealed. The first distress will fall on
	  ourselves : it will be more severely felt by us, than by any
	  part of all his Majesty's dominians ; and it will effect us
	  the longest. The fleets of Great-Britain command respect
	  throughout the globe. Her influence extends to every part of
	  the earth. Her manufactures are equal to any, superior to
	  most in the world. Her wealth is great. Her people
	  enterprizing, and preserving in their attempts to extend and
	  enlarge and protect her trade. The total loss of our trade
	  would be felt only for a time. Her merchants would turn
	  their attention another way. New sources of trade and wealth
	  would be opened: New schemes pursued. She would soon find a
	  vent for all her manufactures in spite of all we could
	  do. Our malice would hurt ourselves only. Should our schemes
	  distress some branches of her trade, it could be only for a
	  time ; and there is ability and humanity enough in the
	  nation to relieve those that are distressed by us, and to
	  put them in some other way of getting their living.</p>

	  <pb n="9" facs="page_image09" />

	  <p>The case is very different with us. We have no trade but
	  under the protection of Great-Britain. We can trade no where
	  but where she pleases. We have no influence abroad, no
	  ambassadors, no consuls, no fleet to protect our ships in
	  passing the seas, nor our merchants and people in foreign
	  countries. Should our mad schemes take place, our sailors,
	  ship carpenters, carmen, sail-makers, riggers, miners,
	  smelters, forge-men, and workers in bar-iron, &amp;c. would
	  be immediately out of employ ; and we should have twenty
	  mobs and riots in our country, before one would happen in
	  Britain or Ireland. Want of food will make these people mad,
	  and they will come in troops upon our farms, and take that
	  by force which they have not money ta purchase. And who
	  could blame them? Justice, indeed, might hang them ; but the
	  sympathetic eye would drop the tear of humanity on their
	  grave.</p>

	  <p>The next thing I shall take notice of, is the advanced
	  prices of goods, which will, not only probably, but
	  necessarily, follow, as soon as the non-importation from
	  Great-Britain, &amp;c. shall take effect. This is a
	  consequence that most nearly concerns you; nor can you
	  prevent it. You are obliged to buy many articles of
	  cloathing. You cannot make them yourselves ; or you cannot
	  make them so cheap as you can buy them. You want Woollens
	  for your winter clothing. Few of you have wool enough to
	  answer the purpose. For notwithstanding the boasts of some
	  ignorant, hot-headed men, there is not wool enough on the
	  continent, taking all the colonies together, to supply the
	  inhabitants with stockings. Notwithstanding all the
	  home-spun you can make, many of you find it difficult, at
	  the year's end, to pay the shop keeper for what the
	  necessities of your families have obliged you to take
	  up. What will you do when the prices of goods are advanced a
	  quarter, for instance, or an half? To say that the prices of
	  goods will not be raised, betrays your ignorance and
	  folly. The price of a ny commodity always rises in
	  proportion to the demand for it ; and the demand always
	  increases in proportion to its scarcity. As soon as the
	  importation ceases in New-York, the quantity of goods will
	  be daily lessened, by daily consumption ; and the prices
	  will gradually rise in proportion. &quot;But the merchants
	  of New-York have declared that, they will demand only a
	  reasonable profit.&quot; Who is to judge what a reasonable
	  profit is?  Why, the merchants. Will they expose their
	  invoices, and the secrets of their trade to you, that you
	  may judge whether their profits are reasonable or not ?
	  Certainly they will not. And if they did, you cannot
	  understand them ; and, consequently can form no judgment
	  about them. You have therefore

	  <pb n="10" facs="page_image10" />



	  nothing to trust to in this case but the honour of the
	  merchants. Let us then consider how far we have reason to
	  trust to their honour.</p>

	  <p>Not to raise the price of a commodity when it is scarce,
	  and in demand, is contrary to the principal and practice of
	  merchants. Their maxim is, to buy as cheap, and sell as
	  dear, as they can. Will they let you have a piece of goods
	  for twenty shillings, which will fetch them twenty-five ?
	  When the stores and shops are full, and a price is
	  demanded which you think unreasonable, you will ask an
	  abatement. If you are refused, you will look elsewhere. But
	  when there are few goods and many buyers, no abatement can
	  be expected. If you won't give the price, your neighbour
	  perhaps is in greater necessity, and must give it. Besides,
	  the merchants knows that no more goods can be imported. He
	  knows that the necessities of the country are increasing,
	  and that what you refuse now at twenty shillings, you will
	  be obliged to take, by and by, at twenty five.</p>

	  <p>But no argument is like matter of fact. You have had one
	  trial of a non-importation agreement some years ago. Pray
	  how did you like it ? Were the prices of goods raised on you
	  then ? You know they were. What remedy had you? A good
	  Christian remedy indeed, but a hard one---patience---and
	  patience only: The honour of the merchants gave you no
	  relief---confound their honour---it obliged me---it obliged
	  many of you, to take old moth-eaton cloths that had lain
	  rotting in the shops for years, and to pay a monstrous price
	  for them.</p>

	  <p>Some indeed, I confess it with gratitude, had honour
	  enough to attempt to regulate the price of Tea, at that
	  time.  Did they succeed ? No.  There was not honour enough
	  in the body of merchants to bring it to
	  effect. Messrs. <gap/> declared at the CofFee-House, that
	  they would be bound by no regulations. They would have their
	  own price for their tea. They had it. And common bohea was
	  sold at the enormous price of nine shillings the pound. Will
	  you again trust to the honour of these men ? You had better
	  trust to the mercy of a Turk.</p>

	  <p>Indulge me in a few sentences more upon this same subject
	  of Tea. It is well known that little or no tea has been
	  entered at the Custom-House for several years. All that is
	  imported is smuggled from Holland, and the Dutch Island in
	  the West-Indies. In this trade the laws of our country are
	  trampled upon. 

	  <pb n="11" facs="page_image11" />


	  The nation is defrauded of its revenues. The sacredness of
	  an oath, the grand security of the liberty, and property,
	  and lives of Englishmen, is prostituted to the vile purposes
	  of private gain, Perjury, and false-swearing are encouraged
	  by those very merchants, to whose honour we are now to
	  trust, that they will not demand an unreasonable profit on
	  their goods.</p>

	  <p>Let the guilty alone take this to themselves. I mean no
	  reflections on the fair-trader. But never will I believe
	  that the man who can cooly and deliberately encourage
	  perjury or false-swearing---who can calmly lay schemes,
	  and repeatedly execute them, in order to defraud his country
	  of her revenues, would ever hesitate one moment, whether he
	  should not prostitute his honour, and cheat me too, could he
	  do it with equal security.</p>

	  <p>The poor culprit, who, perhaps forced by necessity, turns
	  informer, is branded with ignominy---is treated as an
	  out-cast from society: But the lordly merchant, who,
	  wallowing in wealth, can plead no necessity, tramples on the
	  most sacred obligations, and yet holds up his head, and
	  boasts himself a man of honour. O Shame ! Shame! Shame!</p>

	  <p>I know not how it happens, but not only the merchants,
	  but the generality of citizens, treat us
	  <emph>countrymen</emph> with very undeserved contempt. They
	  act as though they thought, that all wisdom, all knowledge,
	  all understanding and sense, centered in themselves, and
	  that we farmers were utterly ignorant of every thing, but
	  just to drive our oxen, and to follow the plough. We are
	  never consulted, but when they cannot do without us. And
	  then, all the plans are hid in the City before they are
	  offered to us. Be the portion they prepare for us ever so
	  nauseous, we must swallow it down, as well as we can. It is
	  not many years since the Mayor, Aldermen and Commonalty of
	  the city, shewed their contempt of us, in the molt insulting
	  manner. They pasled a law to regulate the prices of oar
	  produce; and instead of protecting us in their markets, we
	  were exposed to continual abuse and insults. We could not
	  carry a quart of milk, a duck, a chicken,---I think not an
	  egg,---I am sure not a quail or <emph>snipe</emph>, to
	  market, in peace. If they were scarce, we durst not ask an
	  advanced price; for if we did, a fine---or imprisonment, was
	  our portion.&#x2014;Did they also fix the price of
	  <emph>shop-goods?</emph> catch them at that, and I will
	  humbly ask their pardon.&#x2014;Where was honour at this
	  time?  Troth I cannot tell: But were it necessary, I could
	  easily tell you where she was <emph>not</emph>.</p>

	  <pb n="12" facs="page_image12" />



	  <p>I may perhaps at another time, tell you a little more of
	  my mind upon this matter: At present let us attend to
	  another circumstance, which I think renders the honour of
	  the New-York merchants a little suspicious; and convinces
	  me, that we have no sufficient ground to trust to it. Common
	  sense cannot utterly have quitted the city. There must be
	  some merchants who are sensible of the evil tendency of this
	  Non-consumption, Non-importation, and Non-exportation
	  agreement.  But where is the man who has had honour enough
	  to avow his sentiments and oppose it? Shew him to me, and I
	  will reverence him as &quot;the noblest &quot;work of
	  God.&quot; Six honest merchants, who had honour, virtue, and
	  courage enough, openly to avow their sentiments, and act
	  accordingly, would yet save you, and their country, from
	  ruin.</p>

	  <p>But the conduct of the merchants presents a very
	  different prospect. Whatever their particular sentiments may
	  be, they all appear to acquiesce in this fatal determination
	  of our deluded Congress. They seem to have expected it ; for
	  it is said, that they have imported much more largely than
	  usual: This makes me suspect, that this bustle about
	  Non-importation, &amp;c. has its rise, not from Patriotism,
	  but selfishness. I have heard that merchants sometimes make
	  an artificial scarcity, be engrossing particular commodities
	  in a few hands, that they may avail themselves of the
	  necessity of the buyer, and get a good price. We Countrymen
	  are in this situation. No more goods can be imported: The
	  merchants have us at their mercy: Let them set their price
	  ever so high, necessity will oblige us to come to their
	  terms.</p>

	  <p>Consider the master in another light, and still it will
	  appear, that this Non-importation scheme will and must raise
	  the prices of goods; not only now, but probably for some
	  years to come.</p>

	  <p>There are in New-York many merchants with large capitals,
	  and of very extensive credit; these probably have laid in a
	  large supply of goods, enough to last as long as the
	  Non-importation continues. At least, when their stores are
	  like to become empty, they will have weight enough to break
	  up the agreement. There are many other merchants whose
	  capitals are small, and their credit confined; these
	  probably can have laid in no great stock. If the
	  Non-importation agreement continues any length of time, the
	  wealthy merchant will grow enormously rich, the merchant
	  with a small capital will probably fail. For consider---the
	  small merchant must sell his goods as soon as possible, that
	  he may support his family, and his credit by making timely
	  remittances. The wealthy merchant can wait till the small
	  stares are exhausted, 

	  <pb n="13" facs="page_image13" />


	  and then he may command a double profit: In the mean time
	  the inferior merchant is out of business: His goods are all
	  sold, and sold at a small profit: he cannot import: he must
	  live on his small capital. As soon as the wealthy merchant
	  finds his store near empty, he will have influence enough to
	  break the agreement; and money and credit enough the import
	  largely again: But the inferior merchant is ruined; he has
	  lived on his capital : it is gone : if he is not in
	  <emph>debt</emph>, he has nothing to begin to trade with;
	  and he must become a clerk to his wealthy neighbour.</p>

	  <p>These inferior merchants are of great consequence to the
	  community : they keep down the price of goods and prevent
	  its becoming excessive: they must make quick sales that they
	  may make their remittances in due season. They must
	  therefore take what their goods will fetch: but the wealthy
	  merchant can wait or a better price, without hurting his
	  estate or credit; or else he must be content with the same
	  advance with the merchant of small capital.</p>

	  <p>Another argument to prove that the prices of goods will
	  increase is, that they are already increased, even before
	  the fatal day fixed for the commencement of the
	  Non-importation Agreemeet. Sevetal persons, whom I take to
	  be good judges, have assured me, that the prices of
	  woollens, linens, &amp;c. are very perceptibly increased in
	  the shops in New-York. And I was told, by a very credible
	  man from New-York, that the price of gunpowder was raised
	  from 9 or 10l. to 17 or 181. per hundred. I know you'll
	  stare, and wish to know what could so enormously advance the
	  article of Gun-powder: I'll tell you ; It was the great and
	  sudden demand for it, when the Putmans and Co. of
	  New-England, were in such a violent .hurry to divert
	  themselves with fighting the King's troops; and should these
	  heroes take it into their heads to divert themselves with
	  push-pin, I suppose the price of <emph>pins</emph> would
	  rise in the same proportion.</p>

	  <p>I come now to the consideration of another probable
	  consequence of a Non-importation agreement, which is, That
	  it will excite the resentment of the government at home
	  against us, and induce the Parliament to block up our ports
	  and prevent our trade entirely. It would certainly be good
	  policy in the government to do so. Few Colonies are settled
	  but by a trading people, and by them chiefly for the benefit
	  of trade.  The grand design of England in settling the
	  American Colonies, was to extend her trade---to open a new
	  vent for her manufactures.  If then we 


	  <pb n="14" facs="page_image14" />


	  stop our imports, the benefit of our trade is in a manner
	  lost to her, and she would find but little additional
	  disadvantage, should she stop our trade with all the
	  world.</p>

	  <p>But should the government pursue milder measures---though
	  we indeed have no right to expect it will---yet the Congress
	  have determined the expediency of our stopping our own
	  trade, after a limited time, viz. ten months. In either case
	  the consequence will be much the same; and it matters but
	  little whether the government blocks up our ports, or
	  whether we ourselves voluntarily put an end to our exports,
	  as well as imports; after the 10th of September next we are
	  to have but little trade except with our neighbouring
	  colonies.</p>

	  <p>Consider the consequence. Should the government
	  interpose, we shall have no trade at all, and consequently
	  no vent for the produce of our farms. Such part of our
	  wheat, flax-seed, corn, beef, pork, butter, cheese, as was
	  not consumed in the province, must be left to rot and stink
	  upon our hands.</p>

	  <p>Should the government leave us to ourselves, the little
	  trade that would be open, would never keep these articles at
	  such a price, as to make it worth while to raise more of
	  them than we want for our own consumption.</p>

	  <p>Look well to yourselves, I beseech you. From the day that
	  the exports from this province are stopped, the farmers may
	  date the commencement of their ruin.  Can you live without
	  money?  Will the shop keeper <emph>give</emph> you his
	  goods? Will the weaver, shoemaker, blacksmith, carpenter,
	  work for you without pay ?  If they will, it is more than
	  they will do for me. And unless you can sell your produce,
	  how are you to get money?  Nor will the case be better, if
	  you are obliged to sell your produce at an under-rate ; for
	  then it will not pay you for the labour and expence of
	  raising it. But this is the least part of the distress that
	  will come upon you.</p>

	  <p>Unhappily, many of you are in debt, and obliged to pay
	  the enormous interest of seven pounds on the hundred, for
	  considerable sums. It matters not whether your debts have
	  been contracted through necessity, or carelesness: You must
	  pay them, at <emph>least</emph> the interest, punctually;
	  the usurer will not wait long; indeed you cannot expect he
	  should : You have had his money, and are obliged, in
	  justice, to pay him the principal and interest, according to
	  agreement. But without selling your produce,

	  <pb n="15" facs="page_image15" />

	  you can neither pay the one, nor the other; the consequence
	  will be that after a while, a process of law will be
	  commenced against you, and your farms must be sold by
	  execution: and then you will have to pay not only principal
	  and interest, but Sheriffs fees, Lawyers fees, and a long
	  list of <foreign>et caeteras</foreign>.</p>

	  <p>Nor, under these circumstances, will your farms fetch
	  half what they cost you. What is a farm good for, tha
	  produce of which cannot be sold? Had matters continued in
	  their old course, some one of your neighbours, who knew the
	  value of your farm, might have been willing and able to have
	  given you a reasonable price for it, had you been disposed,
	  or obliged to sell; but he has more wit than to buy a farm,
	  when he cannot sell its produce. Your creditor then, or some
	  rich merchant, or usurer, must take it at their own price:
	  To you it is of no consequence who takes it ; for you are
	  ruined, stripped of your farm, and very probably of the
	  means of subsistence for yourself and family. Glorious
	  effect of Non-exportotion! Think a little, and then tell
	  me---when the Congress adopted this cursed scheme, did they
	  in the least consider your interest ? No, impossible! they
	  ignorantly misunderstood, carelessly neglected, or basely
	  betrayed you.</p>

	  <p>But, it is said, that all legal processes are to be
	  stopped, except in criminal cases.&#x2014;That is to
	  say---the lower class of people are to be deprived of their
	  daily bread, by being thrown out of employ by the
	  Non-exportation agreement; to prevent starving, many of them
	  will be tempted to steal; if they steal they are to be
	  hanged. The dishonest fellow, who owes money, may, by
	  refusing payment, ruin his creditor; but there is no remedy,
	  no process is to be issued against him. This may be justice,
	  but it looks so much like cruelty that a man of a humane
	  heart would be more apt to call it by the latter, than the
	  former name.</p>

	  <p>But pray, by whose authority are the courts of Justice to
	  be shut up, in all civil cases?---Who shall DARE to stop the
	  Courts of Justice?---A very pretty story indeed! I buy a cow
	  of my poor neighbour, and I promise to pay him at Christmas:
	  he wants the money to pay his shoe-maker, taylor, &amp;c. my
	  rascally neighbour, on the other side, owes me ten pounds; I
	  depend upon this money to pay for the cow ; he refuses
	  payment: The Courts of Justice are shut up: 1 cannot sue
	  him, nor can I pay my debt for want of the money.</p>

	  <p>My neighbour Dick Stubbs has a farm which he rents to
	  Peter Doubtful for 20l. a year. Dick is an honest, good sort
	  of a

	  <pb n="16" facs="page_image16" /> 

	  man, but rather negligent, and depends upon this 20l. to
	  make both ends of the year meet, as we say. There is one Tim
	  Twistwell, a Rascal from New-England, who lays claim to
	  Stubbs's farm, tho' he has no more right to it than the Pope
	  of Rome. He knows his right is good for nothing; and has
	  never dared to prosecute it, though he has money enough, and
	  has been <emph>harping</emph> upon it these seven years. But
	  he has lately made several attempts to corrupt Doubtful the
	  tenant. Should he succeed, and get possession of the farm,
	  how is Stubbs to recover his right, when the courts of
	  justice are shut up? You may say that he must wait till the
	  caurts are opened, and then he may prosecute his claim. It
	  may be so. But remember, that the same violence which now
	  shuts the courts of justice, may keep them shut, till poor
	  Stubb is absolutely ruined.</p>

	  <p>Rouse, my Friends, rouse from your stupid lethargy. Mark
	  the men who shall dare to impede the course of
	  justice. Brand them as the infamous betrayers of the rights
	  of their country. The grand security of the property, the
	  liberty, the lives of Englishmen, consists in the due
	  administration of justice. While the courts are duly
	  attended to, and fairly conducted, our property is safe. As
	  soon as they are shut, every thing is precarious : for
	  neither property, nor liberty, have any foundation to stand
	  upon.</p>


	  <p>Tell me not of Delegates, Congresses, Committees, Riots,
	  Mobs, Insurrections, Associations,---a plague on them
	  all.&#x2014;Give me the steady, uniform, unbiased influence
	  of the Courts of Justice. I have been happy under their
	  protection, and I trust in God, I shall be so again.</p>

	  <p>But after all, some of you, I fear, look forward with
	  pleasure, to those halcyon days of security, when the Courts
	  shall be shut. Undisturbed by the clamours of creditors,
	  undismaycd by the sight of the Sheriff, you think to pass
	  your lives in quietness and peace.---But ah! my friends!
	  trust not to the fatal, the ill-judged security. You would
	  not, I hope, be so dishonest as not to do your utmost
	  endeavour to pay your debts ; besides, while the Courts of
	  Justice are shut, you will be apt to be careless. You will
	  neglect paying your interest, your debts will accumulate,
	  your creditors will be irritated ; and as soon as a legal
	  process can be commenced, you will be ruined before you can
	  look about you.</p>

	  <p>Some of you are indebted to the loan-office. You have
	  your money, it is true, at a low rare: You pay only five
	  <foreign>per centum</foreign>:

	  <pb n="17" facs="page_image17" />



	  But if you cannot sell your produce, you can no more pay
	  five <foreign>per cent.</foreign> than seven. The shutting
	  up of the courts of justice can here give you no relief. By
	  virtue of the act which regulates the Loan-Office, your
	  farms, if you fail to pay the interest, will be sold in a
	  limited time, without any judicial process at all.</p>

	  <p>Some of you, also, are tenants at will ; and if you fail
	  in paying your rents, you may be turned off, with little or
	  no warning.</p>

	  <p>Consider now the situation you wilt be in, if
	  Great-Britain, provoked by your Non-importation Agreement,
	  should shut up our ports; or should the Non-Exportation
	  agreed to by the Congress, take effect. In that case you
	  will not be able to sell your produce: you cannot pay even
	  the interest of the money you are indebted for: your farms
	  must be sold, and you and your families turned out, to
	  beggary and wretchedness.&#x2014;Blessed fruits of
	  Non-Importarion and Non-Exportation! The farmer that is in
	  debt, will be ruined : The farmer that is clear in the
	  world, will be obliged to run in debt, to support his
	  family: and while the proud merchant, and the forsworn
	  smuggler, riot in their ill-gotten wealth; the laborious
	  farmers, the grand support of every well-regulated country,
	  must all go to the dogs together.&#x2014;Vile! Shamefull!
	  Diabolical Device!</p>

	  <p>Let us now attend a little to the Non-consumption
	  Agreement, which the Congress, in their Association, have
	  imposed upon us. After the first of March we are not to
	  purchase or use any East-India Tea whatsoever; nor any
	  goods, wares, or merchandize from Great-Britain or Ireland,
	  imported after the first day of December next; nor any
	  molasses, syrups, &amp;c. from the British plantations in
	  the West-Indies, or from Dominica; nor wine from Madeira, or
	  the Western Islands; nor foreign indigo.</p>

	  <p>Will you submit to this slavish regulation?---You
	  must.---Our sovereign Lords and Masters, the High and Mighty
	  Delegates, in Grand Continental Congress assembled, have
	  ordered and directed it. They have directed the Committees
	  in the respective colonies, to establish such further
	  regulations as they may think proper, for carrying their
	  association, of which this Non-consumption agreement is a
	  part, into execution.  Mr. ******** of New-York, under the
	  authority of their High-Mightinesses, the Delegates,
	  by, and with the advice of his Privy-Council, the
	  Committee of New-York, hath issued his mandate, bearing date
	  Nov. 7, 1774, recommending it to the freeholders and freemen

	  <pb n="18" facs="page_image18" /> 


	  of New-York, to assemble on the 18th of November, to choose
	  eight persons out of every ward, tobe a Committee, to carry
	  the Association of the Congress into execution.&#x2014;The
	  business of the Committee so chosen is to be, to inspect the
	  conduct of the inhabitants, and fee whether they violate the
	  Association.&#x2014;Among other things, whether they drink
	  any Tea or wine in their families, after the first of March
	  ; or wear any British or Irish manufactures; or use any
	  English molasses, &amp;c. imported after the first day of
	  December next. If they do, their names are to be published
	  in the Gazette, that they may be <emph>publickly
	  known</emph>, and <emph>universally contemned</emph>, as
	  <emph>foes to the Rights of British America, and enemies of
	  American Liberty.</emph> And then <emph>the parties of the
	  said Association will respectively break off all dealings
	  with him or her.</emph>---In plain English,---They shall be
	  considered as Out-laws, unworthy of the protection of civil
	  society, and delivered over to the vengeance of a lawless,
	  outrageous mab to be <emph>tarred, feathered, hanged,drawn,
	  quartered, and burnt.</emph>---O rare American Freedom!</p>

	  <p>Probably as soon as this point is settled in New-York,
	  the said Mr. ******** in the plenitude of his power, by, and
	  with the advice of his Privy Council aforesaid, will issue
	  his Mandate to the supervisors in the several counties, as
	  he did about the choice of Delegates, and direct them to
	  have Committees chosen in their respective diltricts, for
	  the same laudable purpose.</p>

	  <p>Will you be instrumental in bringing the most abject
	  slavery on yourselves? Will you choose such Committees? Will
	  you submit to them, should they be chosen by the weak,
	  foolish, turbulent part of the country people? Do as you
	  please : but, by HIM that made me. I will not.---No, if I
	  must be enslaved, let it be by a KING at least, and not by a
	  parcel of upstart lawless Committee-men. If I must be
	  devoured, let me be devoured by the jaws of a lion, and not
	  <emph>gnawed</emph> to death by rats and vermin.</p>

	  <p>Did you choose your supervisors for the purpose of
	  inslaving you? What right have they to fix up advertisements
	  to call you together, for a very different purpose from that
	  for which they were elected ? Are our supervisors
	  ourmasters?---And should half a dozen foolish people meet
	  together again, in consequence of their advertisements, and
	  choose themselves to be a Committee, as they did in many
	  districts, in the affair of choosing Delegates, are we
	  obliged to submit to such a Committee?---You ought, my
	  friends, to assert your own freedom. Should 

	  <pb n="19" facs="page_image19" />


	  such another attempt be made upon you, assemble yourselves
	  together; tell your supervisor, that he has extended his
	  commission.--- That you will have no such Committees:---That
	  you are Englishmen, and will maintain your rights and
	  privileges, and will eat, and drink, and wear, whatever the
	  public laws of your country permit, without asking leave of
	  any illegal, tyrynnical Congress or Committee on earth.</p>

	  <p>But however, as I said before, do as you please; if you
	  like it better, choose your Committee, or suffer it to be
	  chosen by half a dozen fools in your neighbourhood,---open
	  your doors to them,---let them examine your tea-cannister,
	  and molasses-jugs, and your wives and daughters
	  petty-coats,---bow, and cringe, and tremble and
	  quake,---fall down and worship our sovereign Lord the
	  Mob.---But I repeat it, By H----n, I will not.---No, my
	  house is my castle ; as such I will consider it, as such I
	  will defend it, while I have breath. No <emph>King's</emph>
	  officer shall enter it without permission, unless supported
	  by a warrant from a magistrate.---And shall my house be
	  entered, and my mode of living enquired into by a
	  domineering Committeeman? Before <emph>I</emph> submit, I
	  will die: live <emph>you</emph>, and be slaves.</p>

	  <p>Do, I say, as you please: but should any pragmatical
	  Committe-gentleman come to my house and give himself airs, I
	  shall shew him the door, and if he does not soon take
	  himself away, a good hiccory cudgel shall teach him better
	  manners.</p>

	  <p>There is one article more of the Association, which
	  exhibits such a striking instance of the ignorance, or
	  inattention of the Congress to the Farmers interest, that I
	  must take notice of it to you; especially as it will give me
	  ao opportunity of mentioning as striking an instance of the
	  arbitrary, illegal, and tyrannical procedure of the
	  Committee of Correspondence in New-York.</p>

	  <p>The article I means, is the seventh, relative to the
	  encreasing of the number and improving ot the breed of
	  sheep. No sheep of any kind are to be exported to the
	  West-Indies, or elsewhere. Why, for God's sake, were
	  <emph>weathers</emph> included in this prohibition?  Will
	  weathers encreasc the number, or improve the breed of sheep?
	  I wish the Gentlemen of the Congress, and the Committee-men
	  of New-York, will try the experiment. Let them buy a score
	  of weathers, and feed, and nurse them for a twelve-month;
	  and then publish an account of the number of lambs they have
	  produced, their enormous size, with the quantity &amp;
	  fineness of their wool; that we may know in what manner the
	  number 

	  <pb n="20" facs="page_image20" />



	  and breed of sheep may be eacreased, and improved by keeping
	  weathers. But let this account be under oath, or I shall not
	  believe that they have succeeded, either in encreasing the
	  number, ot improving the breed. I solemnly declare I never
	  had one lamb produced from a weather in my whole life; and
	  have always been so ignorant, that I should no more expect a
	  lamb from a weather, than a calf from an ox.</p>


	  <p>But it may be said, that weathers will produce wool, and
	  that it is for the fake of the wool that their exportation
	  is prevented. I readily own that weathers will produce wool,
	  though not lambs. But let me ask you, my brother farmers,
	  which of you would keep a flock, of sheep barely for the
	  sake of their wool?  Not oae of you. If you cannot sell yonr
	  sheep to advantage at a certain age, you cannot keep them to
	  any profit. An Ewe should not be kept after she is six years
	  old, nor a weather after he is four: few of you choose to
	  keep them so long. What now must be done with our sheep when
	  they become so old that we can keep them no longer with
	  advantage? We are ordered <emph>to kill them
	  sparingly:</emph> a queer phrase; however, let it pass.  If
	  it is not <emph>classical</emph>, it is
	  <emph>congressional</emph> ; and that's enough. And after
	  having killed them <emph>sparingly</emph>, if we have any to
	  <emph>spare</emph>, we must <emph>spare</emph> them to our
	  poor neighbours. But suppose that after <emph>killing ihem
	  sparingly, and sparing</emph> as many to my poor neighbours
	  as they want, I should, by reason of <emph>killing them
	  sparingly</emph>, have still chore to
	  <emph>spare</emph>--what shall I do whh them ? Exported they
	  must not be. Why! fat them well, and sell them to the
	  New-Yorkers: The deuce take them for a set of gundy gutted
	  fellows---will they let us export nothing?  Do they intend
	  to eat all our wheat, and rye, and corn, and beef, and pork,
	  and mutton, and butter, and cheese, and turkeys, and geese,
	  and ducks, and fowls,and chickens and eggs, &amp;c?  the
	  devil is in't if their bellies are not filled. And yet see
	  their ill-nature and malice against us farmers.---After
	  having furnished them with all this good cheer, which they
	  must have at their own price too, they will not in return
	  let us hava a dish of tea to please our wives, nor a glass
	  of Madeira to cheer our spirits, nor even a spoonful of
	  Melasses to sweeten butter-milk. To be serious---</p>

	  <p>Had the Congress attended in the least to the farmers
	  interest, they never would have prohibited the exportation
	  of sheep, after they came to a certain age. It is the
	  exportation that keeps up the price of sheep; it is the
	  advantageous price that encourages the farmer to feed them:
	  Take away the profit of selling them, and the farmer will
	  keep but very few. For they are not, and I am confident
	  never will be in this country, worth keeping for their wool
	  alone.</p>

	  <pb n="21" facs="page_image21" />
	  
	  <p>However, right or wrong, the Congress have passed the
	  decree. <emph>Thou shalt not export sheep</emph>, was
	  pronounced at Philadelphia ; and, right or wrong, the
	  Committee of New-York are determined to put it in execution
	  : And <emph>thou shalt not export sheep</emph>, is echoed
	  back from New-York.</p>

	  <p>How this decree is to be supported in New-York, may be
	  learned from the following affair. A Gentleman, an officer
	  in the King's service, had purchased a number of sheep to
	  carry with him to St. Vincent's: Mr. GAINE's news-paper says
	  eighteen. The New-Yorkers, probably anraid that they should
	  loose thets share of the mutton, assembled on the dock, sent
	  for the Committee, and in open violation of the laws of
	  their country, obliged the merchant to whom the vessel had
	  been consigned, to have the sheep landed; the sheep were
	  committed to safe durance till the vessel sailed, and then
	  were delivered to the proprietor---I suppose to the person
	  who soJd them to the officer; Though how he could be the
	  proprietor after he had sold them, I cannot see. Had I been
	  the person, I would have had nothing to do with lhem; the
	  committee might have done what they pleased with
	  them---<emph>killed them sparingly</emph>, or
	  <emph>spared</emph> them to their poor neighbours. But had
	  there been law or justice in the government, I would have
	  been paid for them: though, now I think of it, I would have
	  made a present of them to the Committee, upon condition that
	  they should make experiment how far the number and breed of
	  sheep can be increased and improved by keeping weathers; for
	  I have been positively assured, that these sheep, which made
	  all this bustle, were nothing more.</p>

	  <p>Here now, my friends, is a flagrant instance of injustice
	  and cruelty committed by a riotous mob ;---for a number of
	  people, be they Committee-men, or who you please, assembled
	  to do an unlawful action, especially in the night, deserve
	  no better name,---against both the buyer and seller of the
	  sheep, in open violation of the laws of the government in
	  which we live, and of the rights of the city in which it was
	  perpetrated; and not a single magistrate had virtue or
	  courage enough to interpose.  O shame to humanity! Hold up
	  your heads, ye Committee men of New-York!  Deny the charge
	  if ye can. But renember, the instant ye deny it, ye forfeit
	  all pretensions to truth or conscience.</p>

	  <p>Think me not too severe. Anarchy and Confusion, Violence
	  and Oppression, distress my country; and I must, and <emph>will</emph>
	  speak. Though the open violator of the laws may escape
	  punishment, through the pusillanimity of the magistrates,
	  he shall feel the 

	  <pb n="22" facs="page_image22" />

	  lash of my pen; and he shall feel it again and again, till
	  remorse shall sting his guilty conscience, and shame cover
	  his opprobrious head.</p>

	  <p>But perhaps you will say, that these men are contending
	  for our rights; that they are defending our liberties ; and
	  though they act against law, yet that the necessity of the
	  times will justify them. Let me see. I sell a number of
	  sheep. I drive them to New-York, and deliver them to the
	  purchaser. A mob interposes, and obliges me to take my sheep
	  again, and drive them home for my pains, or sell them there
	  for just what they please to give me. Are these the rights,
	  is this the liberty, these men are contending for?  It is
	  vile, abject slavery, aud I will have none of it. These men
	  defend our rights, and liberties, who act in open defiance
	  of the laws? No. They are making us the most abject slaves
	  that ever existed. The necessity of the times justify them
	  in violating the first principles of civil society! Who
	  induced this necessity? Who involved the province in
	  discord, anarchy and confusion? These very men. They created
	  that necessity, which they now plead in their own
	  justification.</p>

	  <p>Let me intreat you, my Friends, to have nothing to do
	  with these men, or with any of the same stamp. Peace and
	  quietness suit you best. Confusion and Discord, and
	  Violence, and War, are sure destruction to the
	  <emph>farmer</emph>. Without peace he cannot till his lands;
	  unless protected by the laws, he cannot carry his produce to
	  market. Peace indeed is departed from us for the present,
	  and the protection of the laws has ceased. But I trust in
	  God, there is yet one method left, which, by prudent
	  management, will free us from all our difficulties; restore
	  peace again to our dwellings, and give us the firm security
	  of the laws for our protection. Renounce all dependence on
	  Congresses, and Committees. They have neglected, or betrayed
	  your interests. Turn then your eyes to your
	  <emph>constitutional</emph> representatives. They are the
	  true, and legal, and have been hitherto, the faithful
	  defenders of your rights and liberties; and you have no
	  reason to think but that they will ever be so.  They will
	  probably soon meet in General Assembly. Address yourselves
	  to them. They are the proper persons to obtain redress of
	  any grievances that you can justly complain of. You can
	  trust their wisdom and prudence, that they will use the most
	  reasonable, constitutional, and effectual methods of
	  restoring that peace and harmony, between Great-Britain and
	  this province, which is so earnestly wished for by all good
	  men, and which is so absolutely necessary for the happiness
	  of us all. Present a petition to them, intreating them to
	  take 

	  <pb n=""/>


	  the matter into their own hands, and to labour earnestly to
	  accomplish so blessed a purpose. But beware of giving them
	  any directions <emph>how</emph> to proceed. As soon as ever
	  you attempt to <emph>instruct</emph> them, you lay
	  yourselves open to be duped and fooled by designing men, in
	  the drawing of your instructions. Some will instruct them to
	  do one thing, and some another, and you will embarrass, but
	  not help forward their deliberations.</p>

	  <p>Your REPRESENTATIVES know perfectly the state of the
	  unhappy breach between our mother-country and us. They want
	  no information in this point. The more you trust them at
	  this time, the more you wil! put it in their power to serve
	  you; and the greater obligation you will lay them under to
	  serve you <emph>faithfully</emph>, and
	  <emph>effectually</emph>. Only beseech them to heal this
	  unnatural breach; to settle this destructive contention;
	  that peace and quietness, and the firm protection of law,
	  and good government, may again be our happy lot. Would the
	  several counties, or towns in the province, conduct
	  themselves in this manner, God, I am confident, would bless,
	  and give a prosperous issue to so good a work.</p>

	  <p>And whatever you may be taught by designing men, to think
	  of the government at home, they, I am certain, would embrace
	  us with the arms of friendship; they would press us to their
	  bosoms, to their hearts, would we give them a fair
	  opportunity. This opportunity our <emph>Assembly</emph>
	  alone can give them. And this opportunity, I trust, they
	  will give them, unless we prevent all possibility of
	  accommodation, by our own perverseness, and ill conduct. And
	  then, God only knows where our distresses may terminate.</p>
